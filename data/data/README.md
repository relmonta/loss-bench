This directory contains datasets used in the project. ERA5 data can be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). Each year is stored in a separate NetCDF file, and each variable is stored in folder named "{variable}_1d", e.g., "uas_1d" for 10m U wind component. A sample of the validation dataset is available for download from Zenodo (see evaluation/evaluate_pr.ipynb).
